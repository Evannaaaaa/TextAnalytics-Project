Analyzing Mental Health Disorders in Social Media Using NLP

•	Analyzed a dataset of over 20,000 English-labeled tweets spanning 2009-2017 to identify patterns related to mental health disorders, utilizing NLP techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF for feature extraction.  
•	Applied machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for text classification. Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving the highest accuracy of 86.25% and the lowest misclassification cost with Naive Bayes and TF-IDF.  
•	Conducted sentiment analysis using TextBlob and VADER libraries to assess mood swings over time, discovering that April had the lowest sentiment score potentially due to seasonal factors.  
•	Implemented topic modeling algorithms like LDA and LSA to distill five key discussion themes in mental health tweets, such as coping with depression, daily struggles, and seeking treatment.
